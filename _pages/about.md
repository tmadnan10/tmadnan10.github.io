Currently, I am a Ph.D. Student of Department of Computer Science at the University of Rochester. Previously, I worked as a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). 

Earlier I completed my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from BUET.

Research Experience
------
Currently, I am working in the ROC-HCI lab led by Prof. Ehsan Hoque, Associate Professor, CSE, UR. I have joined the <b>PARK<b> project, where I am trying to detect Parkinson's from videos containing facial expressions. 
 
During my M.Sc. Thesis and most of my academic career, I have worked on <b>big data analytics</b>, <b>cloud computing</b>, and <b>distributed systems</b>. In my M.Sc. Thesis, I worked on deriving a scalable and federated technique of PCA, which is applicable to any arbitrarily large dimensional datasets. I would like to highlight that, an article titled <b>Fast, scalable, and geo-distributed PCA for big data analytics</b>, based on my M.Sc. Thesis was published in the Elsevier Journal <b>Information Systems</b> in the 98th volume of May 2021. 

I also have experience working on large-scale social media data analytics and a manuscript titled <b>UACD: A Local Approach for Identifying the Most Influential Spreaders in Twitter in a Distributed Environment</b> was published in the <b>Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM)</b> journal. In this work, I have derived a local algorithm of identifying the most influential spreaders on the Twitter social network using our own designed user-attributed code decomposition (UACD) method, which provably can produce more accurate results ($\mathbf{12.5\%}$ on an average)  in $\mathbf{175\times}$ reduced running time. Our derived method has been empirically manifested to be effective in large-scale social graph analysis on a distributed platform.  

In addition, I also have explored some other fields such as <b>Deep Learning</b>, <b>Network security</b>, and <b>Bioinformatics</b>. For example, in the case of network security, I have designed a model with <b>hierarchical attention</b> for the host intrusion detection system (<b>HIDS</b>). In bioinformatics, I proposed a novel multi-layer convolutional network for <b>protein function prediction</b>. The manuscripts for both projects are close to completion.

Research Interest
------
My primary research interest is Heath Data Analytics. I am also interested in Big Data and Social Media, Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing, and Federated Learning.
